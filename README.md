## Introduction

The [N-Queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) is a simple chess-based problem whereby a player attempts to place `N` queen peices on the board such that no queens share the same row, column or diagonal.

## Running

The program was tested using `clisp` on [CygWin](https://www.cygwin.com/). To run:

```
jdorr@DESKTOP-QPTVA3D ~
$ clisp board.lsp
```

You will be prompted to enter the size of board, after which the program will begin to find solutions:
